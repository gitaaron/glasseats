bugs
    -> callback timeout goes into infinite loop
    -> notification not sounding when search result comes in

    -> make location dynamic
    -> implement design of search result card
    -> additional menu items (food items)


---
    -> bundle many search results
    -> navigation and call actions on search result

next 2
    -> voice search

# auth flow
    -> send greeting then redirect back to glasseats.com
    -> separate page for /simulator

# send greeting
    -> three menu items with different icons
        -> nearby
        -> burgers
        -> pizza

# callback
    -> read metadata for CUSTOM response in callback to get the ID
        -> first menu item just queries for food + location from glass API
        -> first menu item gives sushi results + location from glass API
        -> second menu item gives burger results + hard coded location

    -> handle error in glass location
    
# query yelp
    -> handle no results by sending error message
    -> handle server error by sending error message
    -> handle results by sending bundled cards

# send bundled cards
    -> just restaurant name on each
    -> call or navigate menu items

# fix content of bundled cards


----

-> menu icons
-> bundled cards for send yelp
-> location dynamic
-> add food type to search term
